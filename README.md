Android project which showcases some of my art work

The app begins with  first screen(activity) which gives you a button to explore.
When you click on it, you go to the second screen which has two tabs.
Tabs are slideable and build using TabLayout and Fragments.
Each tab has its own ListView which displays a list of images using custom ImageAdapter.
